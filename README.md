# Tribonacci-sequence-challenge
Daily coding challenge: Tribonacci sequence generator
# ðŸ§® Tribonacci Sequence Generator

This project is part of my daily coding challenge series, designed to strengthen algorithmic thinking and demonstrate clean, testable JavaScript code.

## ðŸš€ Challenge Description

Generate a Tribonacci sequence of a given length starting from a custom array of three numbers. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous three.

## ðŸ“¦ Input

- `startSequence`: An array of three numbers (e.g., `[0, 0, 1]`)
- `length`: Desired length of the final sequence (integer)

## ðŸ§ª Example

```javascript
tribonacciSequence([0, 0, 1], 10);
// Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44]
